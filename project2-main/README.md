# NewWeather-3
This is the source code of an iOS app that shows how to get weather information from an open API service (https://openweathermap.org/). 
It was developed as part of the Construction Project Management course at Yonsei University by Professor Hyoungkwan Kim.

Data model and concurrency were inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxYAhXLtAB0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2W9MPjrIbk, respectively.
Thank you!
